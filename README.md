# 🧠 Autonomous Research Agent

An entirely self-contained autonomous AI agent built from scratch in Python. Designed to operate independent of commercial APIs, it leverages local Large Language Models (LLMs) and live web search tools to conduct deep multi-step research on complex topics.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Local LLM Execution:** Runs powerful AI models locally for maximum privacy and zero API costs.
- **Autonomous Web Search:** The agent dynamically formulates search queries, reads webpages, and synthesizes findings.
- **ReAct Architecture:** Utilizes the "Reasoning and Acting" paradigm to navigate complex research tasks requiring multi-step logical deductions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Local LLMs (Ollama / Llama.cpp)
- Web Search Automation
